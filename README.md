# Image-classification-using-deep-learning-with-convolutional-neural-networks-CNNs-
It uses the Keras library with a TensorFlow backend, and is implemented using a Jupyter notebook.

Overview
This code implements an image classification model based on a CNN architecture. It uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 50,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 5,000 images in each class. The dataset is divided into 40,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

The CNN architecture consists of several convolutional layers with ReLU activation, max pooling layers, dropout layers, and a fully connected output layer with softmax activation. The model is trained using the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimization algorithm. The accuracy metric is used to evaluate the model performance on the test set.

Instructions
To run this code, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system, as well as the following libraries:

TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib

Once you have installed the required libraries, you can download the Jupyter notebook from this GitHub repository:

https://github.com/example/image-classification-cnn/blob/main/image_classification_cnn.ipynb

Open the notebook in Jupyter and run each cell sequentially to train and test the model. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations for each step, as well as visualizations of the model performance.
